# lab-manual
latex source for lab manual

Borrowing heavily (and at times outright copied) from Jeremy Manning's lab manual for the [Contextual Dynamics Lab](https://github.com/ContextLab/lab-manual) at Dartmouth. Why try to recreate from scratch something that already looks great and does a good job of explaining how a lab should function?

The link to the lab manuel's "GitHub issues" is broken. The link to the GitHub cheatsheet is also not nworking.
